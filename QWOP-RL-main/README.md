# QWOP-RL

## Description

Train an AI agent to play QWOP using reinforcement learning and imitation learning. Check out the [ACER video summary](https://youtu.be/-0WQnwNFqJM), [DDQN world record video](https://youtu.be/82sTpO_EpEc) or the [write-up on Medium](https://towardsdatascience.com/achieving-human-level-performance-in-qwop-using-reinforcement-learning-and-imitation-learning-81b0a9bbac96).

## Setup

Install Python 3.7

```
conda create -n py37 python=3.7
conda activate py37
```

Install dependencies

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Install Windows-specific dependencies if on Windows

```
conda install -c intel mpi4py
```

Install [Chromedriver](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/home) for
interacting with Chrome through Selenium. Then, start HTTP server for the game

```
python host_game.py
```

## Train and test

Train agent

```
python main.py --train
```

Test agent

```
python main.py --test
```

To save or use new models, the constant `MODEL_PATH` in `main.py`. Note that the agent
plays the game in real-time, so differences in latency between training and testing
computer will affect performance.

## Imitation learning

Record games using human input

```
python main.py --record
```

Train agent from recorded games

```
python main.py --imitate
```

## Tensorboard

Track training performance live or view metrics previous sessions

```
tensorboard --logdir ./tensorboard/
```
